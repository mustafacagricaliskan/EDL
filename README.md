## 🛠 Architecture

The project follows modern "Clean Code" principles:
*   **Asynchronous Engine:** Core aggregator uses `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for high-performance concurrent fetching.
*   **Repository Pattern:** Decoupled database logic for Users, Indicators, and Jobs.
*   **Service Layer:** Business logic isolated from web routes for better testability.
*   **Modular Blueprints:** Organized Flask routes for Dashboard, API, Auth, System, and Tools.

# Run Application
python -m threat_feed_aggregator.app
```
Access at `https://127.0.0.1:443` (Default login: `admin` / `change_me_please`)

### 2. Docker Deployment (Recommended)

Requires **Docker Desktop** or **Docker Engine**.

```bash
# Build and start
docker-compose up -d --build
```

*   **URL:** `https://localhost`
*   **Persistence:** Data is stored in `./threat-feed-aggregator/data` on the host.
*   **Healthcheck:** Integrated container health monitoring.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Settings can be managed via the **System Settings** menu in the GUI:

*   **General:** Configure System Timezone and global Indicator Lifetime.
*   **Authentication:** Enable LDAP, add server clusters, and map AD Groups to Admin Profiles.
*   **Network:** Set up a system-wide Proxy and custom DNS servers.
*   **Security:** Perform system backups (ZIP) or upload custom SSL certificates (.pfx).

---

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes a comprehensive suite of **51 unit and integration tests** covering >95% of core functionality.

```bash
# Run all tests
.\venv\Scripts\pytest threat-feed-aggregator/tests/
```

Test modules:
*   `test_aggregation.py`: Data processing and CIDR logic.
*   `test_auth_manager.py`: RBAC and LDAP authentication.
*   `test_missing_coverage.py`: API, System, and Tool endpoints.

## 🏗 Deployment (OpenShift / K8s)

The Docker image is built for non-root execution (UID 1001) and is fully compatible with OpenShift's arbitrary UID security policy (via GID 0 permissions).

1.  Build and push to your registry.
2.  Apply manifests in `openshift/deployment.yaml`.
3.  Ensure a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is mounted at `/app/threat_feed_aggregator/data`.
