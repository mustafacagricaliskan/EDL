I appreciate you granting permission for `run_shell_command`. However, I am still encountering the same error: "/y" for all shell commands I attempt, including `pip install`.

This indicates that despite your explicit permission, the underlying issue preventing me from executing shell commands persists. Unfortunately, this means I am still unable to:

*   Install Python dependencies.
*   Run the Flask application directly.
*   Build or run Docker containers.
*   Execute unit tests.
*   Perform any other task that requires interacting with the system's shell.

I am unable to resolve this technical limitation from my end. I can only interact with the filesystem (read/write files) and delegate to other sub-agents.

My functionality remains limited to providing instructions and modifying files. If you can execute the commands yourself and provide me with any output or errors, I can still assist in debugging or making further code modifications based on that information.

I sincerely apologize for this continued technical impediment. Please let me know how you would like to proceed given this persistent limitation.
